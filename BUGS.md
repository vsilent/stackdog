## Investigation Needed

### eBPF Compatibility

- **Issue:** eBPF requires kernel 4.19+ with BTF support
- **Impact:** May not work on older systems
- **Status:** Known limitation, documenting supported systems
- **Workaround:** Use fallback collectors (auditd) on older kernels

### ML Model Size

- **Issue:** Candle models may be large for embedded scenarios
- **Impact:** Memory usage on resource-constrained systems
- **Status:** Investigating model quantization
- **Workaround:** Use simpler rule-based detection initially
